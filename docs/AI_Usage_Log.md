# AI Usage Log – MoMo SMS Database Week 2

During this assignment, AI was used only as guidance to help us understand concepts and structure. All technical work was performed by our team.

SQL Guidance: AI helped explain syntax, AUTO_INCREMENT, data types, and foreign key usage.

 We wrote the full SQL script , designed all tables, defined primary and foreign keys, added constraints, inserted sample data, and tested all queries.

We ran all Git commands in Warp, resolved conflicts, and ensured the repository was fully updated on GitHub.

This log demonstrates full transparency: AI assisted only in understanding and planning, while all technical and implementation work was done by our team.
